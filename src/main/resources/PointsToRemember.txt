# Stacks :
  1.) ADT i.e it doesn't dictate about how data is stored, only concern is to the operations that are allowed.
  2.) Push, Pop , Peek
  3.) Sequential Order Access (SOA) i.e always from TOP. LIFO strategy
  4.) Ideal data structure to implement stack is LinkedList (arrays but not ideal one as its not based on SOA strategy)
  5.) Time complexity :
            Linked list - O(1) for all three operations.
            Array - O(n) for insertion if array is full since at that point shifting is required.
  6.) If you already know size or number of elements array could be a good option.
